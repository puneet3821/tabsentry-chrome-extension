# Privacy Policy for TabSentry

**Last Updated:** September 5, 2025

Thank you for using TabSentry. This privacy policy is to inform you about how we handle data in our Chrome extension.

### Data Collection

TabSentry does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information or any other user data. All data related to the extension's functionality, such as your tab limit settings and snooze preferences, is stored locally on your own computer using the browser's built-in storage (`chrome.storage.sync`). This data is synced only across your own devices where you are logged into the same Chrome profile. It is never sent to our servers or any third parties.

### Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions for its core functionality:
* **"storage"**: To save your personal settings locally.
* **"tabs"**: To count your open tabs and display their titles.

We do not use these permissions to track your browsing habits or collect any personal information.
